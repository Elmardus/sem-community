"""#1147 — a saved charger kept a role detection stopped giving.

A charger SEM saved by itself is stored as a device reference. The reference
keeps what detection found last (``found``), so a start that cannot ask
detection still works. But ``refresh_found`` only ever added to it: when a
detection fix stopped giving a role, the old value stayed and every start
used it again (a Zaptec Go saved before #1142 kept the online sensor as its
charge; #1144 needed its own drop for the site limit).

Replacing ``found`` whole at every start would make roles come and go: a
start during Home Assistant's boot reads no states, and an integration that
is still loading shows part of its device. So a role is forgotten only when
detection saw the whole device (``charger_refs.sure_devices``) and no longer
gives it. What the user set (``overrides``, ``cleared``) is never touched.
