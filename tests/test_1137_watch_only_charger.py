"""#1137 — "Detected hardware: tesla_wall_connector — no role matched".

The roles did match. A Tesla Wall Connector reports power, plug, charging
and session energy, but it has no control at all: no current number, no
start/stop, no charge mode. With no car integration that has its own charge
control, the near miss carries those roles, ``missing == ["control"]`` and
no offer. The card read every near miss without an offer as "entities
present, no role matched" and offered a prefilled "please report" issue.

The card now says what was found and that SEM has no control it can drive
(dashboard/card/src/util/detect-rows.js ``nearMissAction`` → ``watch``).
These pins hold the backend half of that contract — the fields the card
reads — and the copy the card shows. The card's own decision is pinned in
dashboard/card/test/detect-rows.test.js.
