"""(#1180) The pack's charge-target number, put back after a forced charge.

GoodWe and the generic switch setup write SEM's charge target into the
``battery_target_soc_entity`` number when a grid charge starts. On many
inverters that number is the pack's standing upper limit
(``soc_upper_limit``, ``battery_max_charge_soc`` …). The stop turned the
switch or the mode back and never wrote the old value back, so a night
charge to 60 % left the pack stopping at 60 % on every sunny day after.

The rules are charge pacing's (#949, #820), for the same reasons:

* the value is SAVED before SEM's first write and PUT BACK on the stop;
* the saved value is PERSISTED, so the next lifetime adopts it instead of
  saving SEM's own 60 % as the user's value (an HA restart never unloads
  the entry, so the number keeps SEM's value across it);
* a number whose value cannot be read is never written: the saved value is
  the only way back. Nor is one whose record could not be read or saved;
* EVERY value SEM wrote since the save is remembered, and a number reading
  any of them is SEM's write not yet read back, never the user's setting
  (class 95). A target can rise during a charge (60, then 70), and two
  packs on one number can ask for two;
* the put-back is not done when it is sent, but when a read shows it
  landed. Until then it is PENDING: tried again on a cycle with no forced
  charge, at most ``MAX_TRIES`` times ``RETRY_S`` apart, never by sending
  the whole stop again (class 108). A number that reads neither SEM's
  values nor the saved one was set by the user: that ends it too. Only
  then is the memory of SEM's values dropped — a user who later picks one
  of them on purpose is not overruled.

ONE hold per config entry, keyed by the ENTITY and shared by every
battery: there is no per-battery target list, so two packs behind one
inverter write the same number. A hold per battery would let the second
pack save the first one's 60 % as its own value to put back.

The store is injected at runtime and duck-typed (``async_load`` /
``async_save``), like ``ChargePacingWriter``'s, so this module stays free
of Home Assistant imports.
