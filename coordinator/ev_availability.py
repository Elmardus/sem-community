    ``True`` when THIS charger's taper detector says the car is still
    full — anchored at a completed charge with nothing drawn since (the
    same predicate that pins estimated_soc to 100) — AND the meter does
    not contradict it. ``None`` for everything else, including no
    detector and a broken one: only a definite yes skips a demand, the
    ``plan_connectivity`` precedent.

    Why it exists: ``build_night_target_map`` answers ``target − daily``
    off the calendar counter, which rolls at midnight — on N1 the ask for
    a 100 % car jumped to the full 20 kWh at 00:01 and the phantom
    displaced the real loads under the peak cap. The counter knows the
    calendar; the detector knows the car.

    Why the meter overrules the anchor (N2, .175 15.08): ``still_full``
    is the deficit below full, and charging SUBTRACTS from it, clamped at
    zero. A real charge delivering the last of the deficit therefore
    reads "anchored, nothing missing" for as long as it takes to overdraw
    by ``ANCHOR_REFUTED_KWH`` — ~90 s at 3.9 kW — and in that window the
    plan was told the car was full and restamped the night without it.
    After a TAPER-detected full it is not a window at all: ``update_energy``
    returns early while ``_full_detected`` stands, so the deficit never
    moves and the #774 refutation can never fire — the car reads full for
    as long as the flag lasts, whatever the meter says.

    The detector cannot close either case alone: it sees energy increments,
    not duration, and a genuine trickle is numerically the same rate. Power
    is known here, so here is where the meter gets its say.

    ``handshake_w`` is the charger's own "actually charging" threshold
    (``adapter.handshake_power_w``, #739) — a real sub-handshake trickle
    still reads full, so #756's contract is untouched. Only a NUMBER may
    contradict the anchor: junk on the wire must not un-full a car.
